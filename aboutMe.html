            <b>
                Well, my name is Jay. I am 27 years old and I was born and raised in the North West of England. I have been in the Army
                since I was 16 years old but I always knew I would have to find another career once I left. I fell into software and 
                coding by accident. I saw a codeacademy advert on Instagram and decided to give it a go, I was slightly disillusioned 
                about what I could actually do with code. I thought I would be able to learn for a couple of months and be able to hack
                into any computer and make myself a AAA game. Little did I know, how much I would fall in love with it. I have since 
                begun my studies with the University of London studying Computer Science. I now know what I would like my next career to 
                be.
